This document enables OpenPGP (RFC4880) to be used in a compliant
manner according to regulations set by the SCA (the State Cryptography
Administration of China) within China.

Specifically, it extends OpenPGP to support the usage of SM2, SM3 and
SM4 algorithms, and provides the SCA-compliant OpenPGP profile
"SCA-SM234".
